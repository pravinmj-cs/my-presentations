## My Presentations

|S.No|Presentation|Context|
|----|------------|-------|
|1|Modern Agile SDLC|A presentation on Agile principles and how we can transform that with DevOps for modern app development. How GitLab can be used effectively for managing SDLC and integrating DevOps tool chain|
|2|Prometheus 101|Getting started with prometheus after we successfully transitioned into monitoring our servers and containers with Prometheus. We started with 5 Servers intially and it was scaled to collect system metrics from 26 servers for our team|
|3|CI/CD|How we used CI/CD principles to increase our quality and delivery for our team projects. We transitioned from Zero to 55% coverage with coding standards, static and security analysis. Deployments was increased from 5-6 per week to an average of 55-70 times a week. This was rolled out to rest of our teams in organization and I am happy to be part of taking part in helping with the transition|
|4|Nit-DevOps -Phase 01|Devised a Road map for smooth DevOps transition to the rest of the teams|
|5|Azure DevOps|One of our on-site client got impressed on what we have achieved with Gitlab and wanted to follow similar practices with Azure. Explore Azure DevOps and guided them with the transition for their SDLC and build automation|
|5|Observability Platform|Exploring Grafana came by luck to me. Intitally my lead was interested in exploring ELK stack. As we were trying to use datadog, I got intrigued with Grafana and started exploring for small DevOps use cases like infrastructure monitoring. We were able to create a perfect monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana. Adding Loki to it for Log aggregation and analytics took it into the next level.By default Nginx(our default server) and syslog metrics were collected and visualized using Grafana Loki. The usage of Grafana greatly evolved to monitoring Redis, PostgreSQL and Kakfa cluster. Alerts were integrated into MS team using web hooks for faster response and feedback loop.|
|6|Best practices|A benchmark goal with standards and best practices for Starters. Done and Rolled out to our trainee and interns|
